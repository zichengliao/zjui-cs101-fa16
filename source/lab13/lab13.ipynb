    "1.  `grab_stations` retrieves a list of National Weather Service stations and prints the station call sign and latitude/longitude.\n",
    "2.  `grab_forecast` accepts the foregoing data and retrieves the current temperature or a forecast, adding this as a column to a similar output.\n",
    "3.  `plot_forecast` plots the resulting temperatures against a map of the state of Illinois.\n",

    "You are going to determine how to compose scripts 1 and 2, and then work together as a team to implement the full toolchain.\n",

    "1.  The Instructor will teach a brief lesson covering how the pieces of the toolchain work and what you need to implement.\n",
    "2.  The class will divide into groups of two.  For each group, one partner will write the `grab_stations` script, while the other will write the `grab_forecast` script. You may share code in class using [this Etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/Pa6X2Bzq0h), but please be careful in using it as a common resource.\n",
    "3.  Once your code works, you and your partner will put your pieces together to make the end result work and plot the figure."
