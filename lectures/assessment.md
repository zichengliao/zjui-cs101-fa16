lec01	8	dynamic, good presentation and narrative, tech worked
lec02	4	less interesting, tech problems (Jupyter froze), material uncompelling, more verbal tics
lec03	7   more interesting topic, better mental prep beforehand, higher-energy; pacing a bit off, consider pushing string formatting back to lec04
lec04   7   not bad, but still no narrative; starting to occupy space and use stage
lec05   7   not bad again, live coding went well
