#   lec04
#### Objectives
-   Use functions to encapsulate code.
-   Understand how scope masks variable names.
-   Use library functions with `import` to make coding easier.

#   lec05
#### Objectives
-   Use function parameters to accept data, and function arguments to apply.
-   Name and apply the parts of a function.

#### Quiz
-   What will the following code block output?

        def squinch():
            a = 5
            value = a ** 2

        print( squinch() )

    1.  10
    2.  25
    3.  An empty string:  `''`
    4.  None of the above.


The named parts of a function are:

    def name(parameters):
        """
        docstring
        """
        # comment
        function_body
        return value


arguments
parameters
comments
    docstrings

#   lec06
#### Objectives
-   Distinguish between modes of executing code:  notebooks, the interpreter, and scripts.
-   Utilize logical operators (`<`, etc.) to determine truth values.
-   Use the control structure `if` to branch a program's logic.

#### Quiz
-   Label the parts of a function correctly.

        def name(parameters):
            """
            docstring
            """
            # comment
            function_body
            return value

-   being careful with scope, arguments, etc. (values at different points)

boolean logic
control (if)

#   lec07
#### Objectives
-   Create and use lists to store multiple associated data values.
-   Use `list(range(n))` to see how a range is constructed.
-   Iterate over the members of a list using a `for` loop.

#### Quiz
-   boolean logic, control


faded example

loop (for)
range
iteration
list

colors = ['red', 'yellow', 'blue', 'jale', 'ulfire']
for color in colors:
    print(color)
