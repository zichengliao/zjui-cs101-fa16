%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{And now for something different...}
  \Enlarge

  \begin{itemize}
  \myitem  A \emph{function} is a small program (block of code) we can run within Python. \pause
    \begin{itemize}
    \mysubitem  Saves us from rewriting code
    \mysubitem  Don't reinvent the wheel!
    \end{itemize} \pause
  \myitem  Analogy:  Functions are more verbs. \pause
  \myitem  Also called subroutine or procedure.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Function calls}
  \Enlarge

  \begin{itemize}
  \myitem  When we want to execute a function, we call or invoke it. \pause
  \myitem  Use name of the function with parentheses. \pause
    \begin{itemize}
    \mysubitem  \texttt{print()}
    \end{itemize} \pause
  \myitem  Many functions come built-in to Python or in the standard library. \pause
  \myitem  Others we will compose at need.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Arguments}
  \Enlarge

  \begin{itemize}
  \myitem  Functions can act on data. \pause
  \myitem  \emph{Arguments} are the input to functions. \pause
  \myitem  Functions can return a value.  (fruitful) \pause
  \myitem  Return values are the output of a function. \pause
    \begin{itemize}
    \mysubitem  \texttt{print('10')} \pause

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Arguments}
  \Enlarge

  \begin{itemize}
  \myitem  \emph{Arguments} are values passed \emph{to} a function. \pause
  \myitem  A function can accept zero to many arguments. \pause
  \myitem  Multiple arguments are separated by commas:
    \begin{itemize}
    \mysubitem  \texttt{min( 1,4,5 )}
    \mysubitem  \texttt{max( 1,4,5 )}
    \end{itemize}
