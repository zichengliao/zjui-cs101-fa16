    \mysubitem  Saves us from rewriting code
    \mysubitem  Don't reinvent the wheel!
    \end{itemize} \pause

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Function calls}
  \Enlarge

  \begin{itemize}
  \myitem  When we want to execute a function, we call or invoke it. \pause
  \myitem  Use name of the function with parentheses. \pause
    \begin{itemize}
    \mysubitem  \texttt{print()}
    \end{itemize} \pause
  \myitem  Many functions come built-in to Python or in the standard library. \pause
