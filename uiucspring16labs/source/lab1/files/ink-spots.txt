If I Didn't Care / The Ink Spots (1939)

If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say

If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
Darlin', if this isn't love, then why do I thrill so much?
And what is it that makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart just stands still so much?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?
