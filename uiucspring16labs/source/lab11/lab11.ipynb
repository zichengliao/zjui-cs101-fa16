    "2.  `grab_forecast` accepts the foregoing data and retrieves the current temperature or a forecast, adding this as a column to a similar output.\n",
    "3.  `plot_forecast` plots the resulting temperatures against a map of the state of Illinois.\n",

    "1.  The TA will teach a brief lesson covering how the pieces of the toolchain work and what you need to implement.\n",

    "3.  The class will divide into two groups (pairs).  One partner will write the `grab_stations` script, while the other will write the `grab_forecast` script.\n",
    "2.  Once your code works, you and your partner will put your pieces together to make the end result work."
